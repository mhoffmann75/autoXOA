# AutoXOA - compile / install Xen Orchestra from source

### For Xen Server 7.X

This branch is developed to work with Xen Server 7.X, developed on XenServer 7. The script will grab the latest versions of XOA-server and XOA-web. For legacy XenServer 6.X users the new web module still should work. IF legacy support is needed for XenServer 6.X check out [branch Version-6.X](https://github.com/hackmods/autoXOA/tree/Version-6.X).

## Purpose

The AutoXOA project installs and configures [Xen Orchestra](https://xen-orchestra.com/#!/) from source. The purpose is to automate the procedure for developer environments and home lab use.

## Instructions

To set up AutoXOA, all you need is a Debian install or variant such as Ubuntu. First install curl. Execute the preceding curl command to retrieve and run the autoXOA script.

Install curl
```
apt-get install curl
```

Run the AutoXOA script
```
curl -L https://goo.gl/W85Cgr | bash
```

And thats it! The default installation is in /xoa/. Preceding instalation, you can start the XO-server package from the autoXOA script. The script is installed in /xoa/autoXOA.sh.


If you are running this on a minimal install, whiptail also needs to be installed.
```
apt-get install whiptail
```

If you are running on Ubuntu, you must run it under sudo -i for the bash script to function.
```
sudo -i curl -L https://goo.gl/W85Cgr | bash
```
